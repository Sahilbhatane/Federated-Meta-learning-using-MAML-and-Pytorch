GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 19 November 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

 Preamble

 The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
 software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
 cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

 The Affero GPL is similar to the ordinary GPL, but it adds an
 obligation for those who modify the program and run it on a server to
 make the modified source code available to the users of that server.

 TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 0. Definitions.

 "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public
 License.

 "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds
 of works, such as semiconductor masks.

 "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
 License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and
 "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

 "To propagate a work" means to do anything with it that, without
 permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
 infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
 computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
 distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
 public, and in some countries other activities as well.

 "To modify" means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a
 fashion requiring permission under applicable copyright law, other than
 making an exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version"
 of the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

 "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
 making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of
 a work.

 "A Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
 standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
 interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
 is widely used among developers working in that language.

 "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the
 source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work)
 run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
 control those activities. However, it does not include the work's
 system libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
 programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
 which are not part of the work.

 "Installation Information" for a work in object code form means any
 methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required
 to install and execute modified versions of a covered work on a
 user's computing device (if the work is a User Product), and to make
 accessible the Corresponding Source of the modified work.

 "User Product" means either (1) a "consumer product", which means
 any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,
 family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
 incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a
 consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of classifying
 a product as a consumer product.

 "Propagate" and "convey" have the same meaning as in the GNU General
 Public License v3.

 1. Source Code.

 The source code of a work covered by this License must be made
 available under the terms of this License when you convey the work or
 when you interact with users remotely through a network server offering
 the work. The Corresponding Source for a work in object code form is
 the complete corresponding source code.

 2. Basic Permissions.

 All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
 copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
 conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
 permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
 covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
 content, constitutes a covered work. This License is not intended to
 limit any permissions you might have under applicable law.

 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

 No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
 measure under any applicable law that prohibits circumvention of such
 measures.

 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

 You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
 receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
 appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
 keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
 non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
 keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
 recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

 You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
 produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
 terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
 conditions:

   a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
   it, and giving a relevant date.

   b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
   released under this License and any conditions added under section
   7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to keep
   intact any notices.

   c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License
   to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will
   therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional
   terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of
   how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license
   the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such
   permission if you have separately received it.

   d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
   Appropriate Legal Notices; however, the requirement to display
   Appropriate Legal Notices applies to the interfaces covered by the
   term "interactive user interface" in the Licenses.

 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

 You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
 of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
 Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these
 ways:

   a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
   (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a copy
   of the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
   customarily used for software interchange.

   b) Accompany the object code with a written offer, valid for at
   least three years, to give anyone who possesses the object code a
   copy of the Corresponding Source (and the offer may be valid for
   longer than three years). This alternative is allowed only for
   noncommercial distribution and only if you received the object code
   with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b of the GNU GPL v3.

   c) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
   place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
   Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
   further charge. You must ensure that the Corresponding Source
   remains available for as long as you offer access to the object
   code.

   d) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
   written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This option is
   allowed only occasionally and noncommercially; it does not apply to
   mass distribution.

 7. Additional Terms.
